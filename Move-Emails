; AutoITScript code.

; Have your Sharepoint window open in your left screen, Outlook open in the right.
; The script will select the very bottom email, then move to the attachment file and drag it to your Sharepoint window.
; Very basic stuff, I just needed to copy several hundred PDF files attached in my emails this way.  I don't like .eml files.
